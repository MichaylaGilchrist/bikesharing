There are several graphs which focus on weekday usage, user type (customer vs subscriber), and gender of users. It shows that the majority of users are males and both males and females use bikes around the same day during the work week, 8 am and 5-6pm which are common commute times for cities. The unknown gendered riders that are just customers show that they take more rides on the weekend which could point to high tourist use. The unknown users, both customers and subscribers, tend to take longer trips than males and females further supporting tourist use.   
## Summary
Overall, a large city would benefit from a bike rental. Bike rentals with multiple pick up/drop off locations would help reduce car traffic, increase the travelability with tourists, and benefit everyday commuters. It would be benefitial to view the unknown gender trips in greater detail as to see if there is a tourist attraction component so other cities can take that into consideration when designing pick up and drop off locations. Further analysis of bike repair costs and cause of breakdowns would also assist other cities plan for their projected costs.
